# Insurance_App





> **Project Description and Goals:**
The goal of this project is to develop a web-based application that enables a small insurance agency to keep track of expiring insurance policies for their clients. The app should allow employees and admins to upload and download insurance PDFs, view a list of expiring policies, and send notifications to clients to remind them of upcoming expirations.
> 
1. Stakeholders and Their Roles:
- Employee: The employee is responsible for uploading insurance PDFs, viewing the list of expiring policies, and sending notifications to clients.
- Admin: The admin has access to all functionalities of the app and can manage employees and their roles.

                                **Functional Requirements:**

- App should have two roles: employee and admin. Employees can view policies and send notifications. Admins can manage employees and their roles.
- Insurance PDF Upload and Download: The app should allow employees to upload insurance PDFs and download them when needed.
- List of Expiring Policies: The app should provide a list of all expiring policies, including policy holder name, policy number, and expiration date.
- Notify clients of upcoming policy expirations via bulk or individual sending.

                              **Non-Functional Requirements:**

- Security: Provide secure access to app data and functionality through role-based authentication and permissions.
- Usability: Ensure an intuitive and easy-to-use interface.
- Performance: Ensure fast and responsive app performance.
1. Assumptions and Constraints:
- Develop using web technologies (HTML, CSS, JS) and a backend framework (e.g. Node.js).
- Host on a cloud platform (e.g. AWS, Azure).
- Access through modern web browsers (e.g. Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
1. Dependencies:
- Depend on a PDF parser library to extract data from uploaded insurance PDFs.
- **The app will depend on a notification service provider such as Twilio to send SMS notifications to clients.**
1. Acceptance Criteria:
- The app should be able to differentiate between an employee and admin user.
- The app should allow employees to upload and download insurance PDFs.
- The app should display a list of all expiring policies.
- The app should provide the ability to send notifications to clients, both individually and in bulk.

                       **Risks and Mitigation Strategies:**

> Risk: The app may not be able to parse all types of insurance PDFs.
Mitigation: Conduct thorough testing and include support for the most common insurance PDF formats.
> 

> Risk: The app may not be able to send notifications due to technical issues with the notification service provider.
Mitigation: Choose a reliable and scalable notification service provider with a good track record of uptime and support.
